Smartie4kodi v1.0.2
===================

smartie4kodi is a DLL plugin for LCD Smartie (http://lcdsmartie.sourceforge.net/) which listens for notification from Kodi and displays information on a 2 line LCD character display. While the default line width is 20 character there is no reason it can’t be configured for a short or longer width.

Installation
------------

1) Download the zip file containing the smartie4kodi DLL and associated files.
2) Copy the smartie4kodi.dll and the smartie4kodi.cfg to the LCD Smartie plugins folder.
3) Copy the other dll files to the LCD Smartie main folder.

The DLL provides the following LCD Smartie functions:

Function 1: Is meant to be displayed on line 1 of an LCD display. It shows title information as well as other navigation information (FF, rew, Volume)

Function 2: Is meant to be displayed on line 2 of an LCD display. Upon initial playing of a title smartie4kodi shows various lines of information about the title. It then shows current progress in a title.

Function 3: Lets you know if Kodi is running. It can be used for custom actions inside LCD Smartie.

Function 4: Displays the current version of the smartie4kodi DLL. Not really useful unless you are unsure which version of the DLL you are running.

Function 5: Displays custom information from kodi.
	usage: $dll(smartie4kodi,5,method,item#sub-item)

	Example 1: 
		$dll(smartie4kodi,5,Player.GetPlayers,#type)
		In this example we are calling the Player.GetPlayers method. This method returns PlayerId and type. We want the value associated with type.

	Example 2:
		$dll(smartie4kodi,5,Player.GetProperties,totaltime#minutes)
		In this example we calling the Player.GetProperties method to get the totaltime item. The item returns hours,minutes,second and milisecond. We are looking for the the minutes.

Function 6: Display the current icon (from function 1). Can be useful for forming your own screens.
	usage : $dll(smartie4kodi,6,,)

Function 7: Display Label - If kodi is not running then it will display the "knf_str" string.
	usage : $dll(smartie4kodi,7,method,item)

	Example  1:
		$dll(smartie4kodi,7,XBMC.GetInfoLabels,System.CurrentWindow)
		This example will show the page or menu you are on (Home/Movies/Music/etc) 

	Example 2:
		$dll(smartie4kodi,7,XBMC.GetInfoLabels,System.CurrentControl)
		This example will show the current control/sub menu item.

Function 8: Duplicate of function 7 except it displays nothing instead of the "knf_str" string.

Function 9: Display kodi state
	Returns an integer of the current state: kodi_not_running(0),none(1), play(2), stop(3), pause(4), ff(5), rew(6), mute(7),idle(11 -- see idle_timer)

Function 10: Reset idle timer

Function 11: Get connected state 
	This function is better at detecting Kodi than function 3 since function 3 will return true before you can connect to Kodi.

Function 12: Media Type
	Returns an integer of the current Media Type: kodi-not-running(0),nothing playing(1),movie(2),episode(3),channel(4),song(5),picture(6)   

Function 13: Progress and Navigation
	Displays  Navigation Symbol + Progress bar switches to navigation like Function 1

Function 14: Simple Title

	Episode: Episode Title (year) for Episodes and Showtitle for TV

Function 15: Simple more info
	Displays  Album (Year) for Songs and Show Title (Year) for Episodes "notapp_str" for anything else 

Function 16: Artist
	Shows Artist name for Music or "notapp_str" for anything else  

Function 17: End Time
	Shows Finish time for Current Media in form "ends_str" --:-- AM/PM if nothing playing just dashes

Configuring LCD Smartie
-----------------------

In the lcd Smartie setup window for line 1 & 2 enter the following:
  
$dll(smartie4kodi,1,,)
$dll(smartie4kodi,2,,)

Configure the following for both lines:

Enable “Don’t scroll this line”
Disable “Continue on next line”
Disable “Center Text”

Advanced Setup
--------------
If you want to switch between screens you can use the following lcd smartie configurations to get you started:

Refresh interval 1000. screen 1-3:Enabled & Sticky

screen 1
line1: $dll(smartie4kodi,8,XBMC.GetInfoLabels,System.CurrentWindow)IDLE
line2: SCREEN

screen 2
line 1:$dll(smartie4kodi,7,XBMC.GetInfoLabels,System.CurrentWindow)
line 2:$dll(smartie4kodi,7,XBMC.GetInfoLabels,System.CurrentControl)

Screen 3
line 1:$dll(smartie4kodi,1,,)
line 2:$dll(smartie4kodi,2,,)$dll(smartie4kodi,10,,)

Action 1: $dll(smartie4kodi,9,,) = 1 gotoscreen(2)
Action 1: $dll(smartie4kodi,9,,) = 2 gotoscreen(3)
Action 1: $dll(smartie4kodi,9,,) = 11 gotoscreen(1)

Notifications
-------------
smartie4kodi listens for the following notifications from Kodi

"Player.OnPlay"
"Player.OnPause"
"Player.OnStop"
"Player.OnSpeedChanged"
"Application.OnVolumeChanged"

When the dll receives notifications it will display different information based on which notification is received and which player you are using (movie, song, picture, tv).


Configuration
-------------

While I have tried to make smartie4kodi somewhat configurable it is also based on what I wanted to see on each screen.

See the smartie4kodi.cfg file for information about configuring smartie4kodi.
